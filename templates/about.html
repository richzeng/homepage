	<h1>about</h1>
<p>I'm Richie. I used to be called Fanqi but since nobody </br> could pronounce it I changed my name. I named myself </br> after a character in Pokemon. I'm rather grateful my mom </br> didn't let me name myself Ash or Brock.</p>

<p>I'm currently a 2nd year Electrical Engineering and Computer </br> Science major at UC Berkeley. I'm an officer of Hackers at Berkeley, </br> the largest engineering organization on campus. We host hackathons and run workshops where we teach practical programming skills.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I enjoy cooking and photography. </br> To offset my otherwise sedentary lifestyle I go the gym and </br> occasionally play ultimate frisbee.</p>
